**SOLID Principles in Java - Code Examples**

This repository contains practical examples of SOLID principles implemented in Java. Each principle is demonstrated with both good and bad examples to illustrate the concepts clearly.
What are SOLID Principles?
SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
